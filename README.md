Restaurant Inspection Scores vs. Mean Income (SF/LA)

Our machine learning project is designed to determine if there is a correlation between average income of a city and restaurant inspection scores. Our hypothesis predicts that scores will fluxuate with higher income areas recording higher inspection scores. We first compiled restaurant data on various cities across the country to determine the best sample cities. San Francisco and Los Angeles data proved to be the most insightful, providing inspection scores as well as inspection descriptions and critical levels, and detailed location info. We used latitute/longitude readings to geocode specific locations of restaurant inspections within SF and LA. From there we used matplotlib, plotly and tableau to illustrate many different aspects of our data.
